# CoderDojoDC.com

Welcome to the CoderDojoDC website source code (the site itself is hosted by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), generated via [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)).

Todo list: [![Waffle](https://badge.waffle.io/CoderDojoDC/CoderDojoDC.github.io.png?label=ready)](https://waffle.io/CoderDojoDC/CoderDojoDC.github.io)

## Creating a new post

So you want to create a new post? This probably happens a lot... The easiest way is probably to copy the content from an existing file in the `_posts` directory and create a new file with an appropriate `YYYY-MM-DD-url-to-page-usually-post-title.md` name.

The [YAML front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) includes some specifications for the post, including the layout template that should be used, the title, the date, some tags (an array of strings), and anything else you want to store up there. The bare minimum for a post is `layout`, `date`, and a `title`. It looks like this in one example:

```
---
layout: post
title: Making progress!
date: '2012-12-04T10:45:00-05:00'
tags: []
tumblr_url: http://coderdojodc.com/post/37190285749/making-progress
---
```

Here are the [jekyll instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

The format for post itself is done in [markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html)

You can include code samples and block quotes with the special syntax, like so:

```liquid
{% highlight python %}
def foo(t):
  print("this is highlighted")
{% endhighlight %}
```

```markdown
> Here's a quote
> by someone...
```

## How it works?

*Github does this automatically when someone commits a change to the `master` branch of the `CoderDojoDC/CoderDojoDC.github.io` repository.*

Jekyll generates static pages based on the markdown and html template code of all files with supported extensions (typically .md, .markdown, or .html) that have [YAML front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). You can do this manually, [see below](#running-the-source-code-locally-for-testing----mac-osx-advanced).

Jekyll uses the [liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) templating language, and github pages gives us some  stuff out of the box, along with limited plugin support, see here for github's pages documentation:

* [Using Jekyll with github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
* [Github pages basics](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles)

## Editing/creating templates

You'll want to look at the `_layouts` directory for the `default.html` template (used in most pages). Files with an `.html` extension likely also include some templating.

## Running the source code locally for testing (advanced)

This works for Mac OSX and Linux

1. Install [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)
2. Install ruby 2.1.1 with: `rvm install 2.1.1`
3. Install bundler (probably as root): `sudo gem install bundler`
4. Git clone this repo and change to the root folder.
5. Run bundle install: `bundle install`
6. Run jekyll serve: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
7. Assuming everything worked properly, open your browser to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
