Thanks to a strong letter of support from Montgomery County Councilmember George Leventhal and help from Kellie Dutton and Jewru Bandeh from the Community Use of Public Facilities, CoderDojoDC has been awarded a substantial subsidy through the Community Access Pilot Program against the rental fee for the perfect meeting place with great WI-FI in Silver Spring’s new Civic Building!
We’re scheduled for eleven alternate Saturdays, beginning January 5, 2013 at 10 AM (tho we have the room from 9 AM on and could use help setting up.)  We’ll keep everything in a Google Calendar.
So register below, spread the word, retweet, help us plan the first meeting on our mailing list, check out our wish-list, and maybe tweet a quick thanks to @georgeleventhal for his support!
