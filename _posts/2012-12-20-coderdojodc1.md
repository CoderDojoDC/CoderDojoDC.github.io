Thanks to a strong letter of support from [Montgomery County Councilmember George Leventhal](http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/levtmpl.asp?url=/content/council/mem/leventhal_g/about.asp) and help from Kellie Dutton and Jewru Bandeh from the Community Use of Public Facilities, CoderDojoDC has been awarded a substantial subsidy through the Community Access Pilot Program against the rental fee for the perfect meeting place with great WI-FI in Silver Spring’s new Civic Building!

We’re scheduled for eleven alternate Saturdays, beginning January 5, 2013 at 10 AM (tho we have the room from 9 AM on and could use help setting up.)  We’ll keep everything in a [Google Calendar](http://coderdojodc.com/calendar).

So register below, spread the word, [retweet](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoDC/status/281727851399610368), help us plan the first meeting on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/coderdojodc), check out our [wish-list](http://amzn.com/w/BUVZ9IBUOPY7), and maybe tweet a quick thanks to [@georgeleventhal](https://twitter.com/georgeleventhal) for his support!
