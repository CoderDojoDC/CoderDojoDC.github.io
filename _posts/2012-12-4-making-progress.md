Making progress!
================

We have at least three very strong leads on free and perfect meeting
spaces with great WIFI!

So, as we look to hold our first CoderDojo meeting in early January, we
are collecting donated laptops, which we will refurbish with
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Linux, and make available to attendees
who are unable to bring their own machines.

We’re also going to need USB mice, mousepads, power strips and extension
cables, popcorn, bottled water and anything else folks think we’ll need.

Once we confirm the time and place of our first Dojo, we’ll schedule a
Google Hangout to touch base and plan our first lesson.

Meantime, please spread the word by encouraging folks to join the
[mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coderdojodc)
and follow [@CoderDojoDC](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoDC)!
