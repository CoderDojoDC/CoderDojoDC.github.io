Wish List and When is Good?
===========================

Two quick announcements:

First, we’ve started a wish list on
Amazon: <http://amzn.com/w/BUVZ9IBUOPY7>

\

The CoderDojo format is pretty firm about keeping things low-stress by
not introducing any costs for anybody, and relying on donations.  So
please don’t go out and buy these things.  Rather just reply here or let
[@CoderDojoDC](https://twitter.com/coderdojodc "@CoderDojoDC") or the
[mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coderdojodc "CoderDojoDC Mailing List")
know if you have something like them around the house or office you can
donate.  We’ll keep all this stuff in a big trunk to make it easy to set
up and tear-down future meetings.

\

Second, while most folks have suggested alternate Saturday mornings
might work best for CoderDojoDC, a few folks have mentioned preferring
other times.  We figured we ought to take a quick
poll: <http://whenisgood.net/CoderDojoDC>  …just paint in the hours that
work for you (twice a month) and, if you like, enter your name and any
comments before hitting Send Response.

 

P.S. If you have an old Dell or other laptop sitting around, we’re happy
to take it off your hands, put Ubuntu on it, and keep it in the trunk
for use by any kids who don’t show up with their own machine!
