I’ve been taking the kids to CoderDojo sessions at Blackrock Castle on Sunday mornings. I can’t say enough good things about CoderDojo. Put a bunch of kids and computers in the same room with just enough guidance/help from grown-ups and magical things happen. Blackrock castle is a great venue for CoderDojo - it’s already a child-friendly place with an emphasis on science and astronomy - there’s an observatory atop the castle’s tower. There’s a cafe on the castle grounds that serves great coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows for that mid-morning lag. At the Blackrock venue, kids learn HTML, Javascript, Scratch and Sketchup but look around and you’ll find at least one or two kids on Minecraft too. It’s all good ;-)

I had almost 3 weeks of holidays over the christmas period so I needed a pet project. I decided to try to get Javascript in Minecraft. The project became ScriptCraft and it’s up on my github. ScriptCraft is a Minecraft mod that lets you run javascript in Minecraft.

Once the mod is installed, launch Minecraft, create a new world and then type `/js1+1`

The number 2 is printed. Everything after `/js` is evaluated as javascript…
