Resnick’s group developed the Scratch programming language to make coding accessible and appealing to everyone. In his TEDxBeaconStreet talk, Resnick gives a sneak preview of the next generation of Scratch, and demonstrates how millions of people around the world are using Scratch to learn to code — and also to learn many other things.
