title: “DojoCon is quickly becoming a highlight in the calendar for both existing
  and potential mentors. There is a determination among the conference organisers
  to make it as successful as possible in terms of all the mentors getting to know
  each other, looking at firm ways of taking the movement to the next level, and agreeing
  on further inter-dojo collaboration.”
