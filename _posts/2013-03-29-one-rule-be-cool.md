“Look around, you see computers everywhere! our modern world is powered by computers

but what powers computers…? Computers are powered by CODE, Code written by people, by PROGRAMMERS. but there are not enough programmers… what can we do? CoderDojo is set for the job! 

supporting children to become Coder-Poets by teaching each other and having fun while learning!”
