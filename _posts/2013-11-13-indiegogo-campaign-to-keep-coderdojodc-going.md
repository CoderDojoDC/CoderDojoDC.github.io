CoderDojo is a movement to provide free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. In [CoderDojoDC](http://coderdojodc.com/)’s first year at the Silver Spring Civic Center we had multiple sessions focused on learning about technologies that make the Web Work: HTML, JavaScript and Python. We also explored educational tools like Scratch and Minecraft that introduce kids to computing in a fun and accessible way. The sessions were free and open to all who registered on the Website. 

We want to continue to hold meetings at the [Silver Spring Civic Building](http://www.silverspringdowntown.com/go/silver-spring-civic-building-and-veterans-plaza) in downtown Silver Spring, because it is close to the Metro, and nearby shops. It is also just off the beltway for people that are driving from further away.  But we need your help to pay the $420 dollar fee for 12 sessions (to meet bi-weekly).
