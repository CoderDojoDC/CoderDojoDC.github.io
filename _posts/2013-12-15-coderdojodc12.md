The Silver Spring Civic Building is located near the intersection of Fenton Street and Ellsworth Drive in downtown Silver Spring. Nearby parking garages provide plenty of free parking. Depending on the week, we may be located in different rooms inside the Civic Building. If you do not see us, someone is usually at the front desk who can help.
