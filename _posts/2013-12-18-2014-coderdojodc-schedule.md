[The Indiegogo Campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/coderdojodc/x/4460024) was a success (thanks!) ; we collected $555.00 of the $500 goal. There was a 7% processing fee (4% for indiegogo + 3% for credit card processing) which leaves $511.14. The Silver Spring Civic Building wanted $440 for 12, 2 hour sessions. This leave $71 to purchase Raspberry Pis to raffle off to those who donated, which I will order right away. 

Eric Rasch of the SSCB helped us come up with the schedule. Unfortunately our normal slot wasn’t available, but Eric was able to book Sundays from 2-4PM. We thought having a usual time would be preferable than meeting at unpredictable times. 

Things start up bi-weekly on the 2014-01-05, but you’ll notice that the bi-weekly pattern needed to break up in a couple places.There is a Google Calendar which you should be able to add to your calendaring app as an [iCal feed](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/obqc9qr5goaii0n5r90ejhv1t4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).
Here are the dates/times and room names in case you would rather have them as a list:

So, I guess we need to start thinking again about how we want to start things up on January 5th?
