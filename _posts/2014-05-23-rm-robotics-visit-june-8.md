Several members of the [Richard Montgomery High School Robotics Club](http://rmrobotics.weebly.com/)
will be joining us to teach everyone about robotics and give a tutorial using
Lego NXTs. The team recently competed at the [FIRST Robotics](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc)
world championship event and were awarded a 2nd place overall ranking. About
2800 teams from around the world compete in their division, so this is no
small accomplishment. They’re also bringing SheRMan, their FIRST Robotics robot,
and will let the kids drive it around as time permits. SheRMan is a pretty cool
robot, so adults in the group may also be interested in some of the finer pointsx
of its design.
