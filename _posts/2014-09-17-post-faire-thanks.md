Thanks to everyone who came out to help or just to visit our booth at the 2nd Silver Spring Maker Faire on Sunday (09/14)! The Faire was a great success thanks to all the hard work of the volunteers, especially the kids who did such an outstanding job teaching others about binary numbers. Not only were we able to spread the word about our club and generate a lot of interest from vistors to the Faire, we were also one of only a few exhibitors who received a "Maker of Merit" award from the event organizers &ndash; which is another testament to the fantastic job our members did with their teaching and outreach activities! Great job everyone!

We are looking forward to our next meeting (9/28), which will resume on our regular schedule (every second Sunday, 3-5 pm) at the Elks Lodge in Rockville.  The [meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/201207262/, "CoderDojoDC on meetup.com") has full directions and other logistical details.
