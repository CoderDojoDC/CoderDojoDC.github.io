Thanks to everyone who came out on Sunday (09/14) to help, or just to visit, our booth at the 2nd Silver Spring Maker Faire!  The event was a great success, thanks to all the hard work of our volunteers, especially the kids who did such an outstanding job teaching others about binary numbers.  Not only were we able to spread the word about our club and generate a lot of interest from vistors to our booth, we were also one of only a handful of exhibitors to receive a "Maker of Merit" award from the event organizers &mdash; another testament to the fantastic job our members did with their teaching and outreach activities!  Great job everyone!

We are looking forward to our next meeting (9/28), which will resume on our regular schedule (every second Sunday, 3-5 pm) at the Elks Lodge in Rockville.  The [meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/201207262/ "CoderDojoDC on meetup.com") has full directions and other logistical details.  See you there!
