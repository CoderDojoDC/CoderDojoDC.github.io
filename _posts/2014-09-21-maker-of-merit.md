CoderDojoDC was proud to have been awarded a Maker of Merit Ribbon for our booth at the 2014 Silver Spring Maker Faire, and we thought it would be nice to share the award with everyone who helped out.  So to everyone who helped out, here's a virtual badge that you can post on your webpages and blogs.
