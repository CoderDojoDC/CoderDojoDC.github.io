<p>CoderDojoDC is proud to have been singled out with a "Maker of Merit" award for our booth at the 2014 Silver Spring Maker Faire, and we thought it would be nice to share the badge with everyone who helped out.  So to all our helpers, here's a virtual badge that you can copy and post on your webpages and blogs.</p>

<p>See you next Sunday at the Elks' Lodge in Rockville!</p>
