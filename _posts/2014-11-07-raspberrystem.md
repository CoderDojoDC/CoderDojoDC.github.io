We'll have two main activities at our next Dojo. First, Brian Silverman from
[RaspberrySTEM](http://www.raspberrystem.com/) will be bringing RaspberrySTEM Creator sets to our meeting and
teaching everyone how to use GPIOs, LEDs, and buttons to Raspberry Pis! And,
back by popular demand, we'll have more interactive fiction programming. For
those who missed our first interactive fiction meeting, we use a program called
Twine to write our own choose-your-own adventure web pages. If your son or
daughter likes to write, this is a great introduction into computer programming.

See the [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/212623722/) for more
details.
