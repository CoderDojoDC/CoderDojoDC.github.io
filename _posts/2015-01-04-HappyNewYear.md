Happy New Year from CoderDojoDC!  We are looking forward to many fantastic new projects and adventures in coding this year.  In addition to our bi-weekly meetups with our regular Minecraft, Inteactive Fiction, and Scratch interest groups, we have the Pawelbot robot project, another visit from the Nao robot, an upcoming App Inventor introduction, continued collaboration with the Codestarter charity that supplies laptops to young coders, and many more great things on the horizon.

We look forward to seeing you at our 2015 meetings!
