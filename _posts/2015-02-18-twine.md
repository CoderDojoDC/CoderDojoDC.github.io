Remember Zork from the 80s?  Choose-your-own-adventure books?  Interested in
writing story-like games that your friends can play?

Learn how to combine your story ideas with programming with our introduction to
programming interactive fiction. Melissa Ford will show everyone how to get
started with [Twine](http://twinery.org), a very simple program that grows with the programmer's
abilities.

The introduction will be about fifteen minutes long. Chris Klimas, the inventor
of Twine will be joining us as well and helping out as a mentor! After the intro
we'll break as normal into groups for further work/play with interactive
fiction, Scratch, HTML and Minecraft hacking.

Update: Chris posted to [his blog](http://chrisklimas.com/helping-at-coderdojodc/) about our meeting.
