Once you've gotten to know core programming concepts in Scratch, a good next step is to try some Python.  Python is a great language for new programmers because it is versatile and powerful, yet relatively easy to learn.

There are many great resources for learning Python online.  Here are a few to check out:

1. https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/
2. http://learnpythonthehardway.org
3. http://www.codecademy.com
4. Python for Kids, by Jason R. Biggs (http://www.nostarch.com/pythonforkids): some free content available on the No Starch website -- you can also check out a copy from your local library.

Another good way to learn programming is by modifying existing programs. In our Python interest table, we are working on a "flashcard" program that quizzes the user on the state capitals.  You can modify download and modify this program from our [club Github repository](https://github.com/CoderDojoDC/python-table).
