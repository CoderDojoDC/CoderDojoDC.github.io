At our meeting on Sunday, November 8, 2015 (3-5 pm), Ginger Butcher from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center will be joining us to share her experiences working at NASA and the importance of programming and engineering in her career. She is also one of the inventors of the littleBits Space Kit and will lead a littleBits space activity for the group. She's bringing a lot of equipment, so you don't need to have your own littleBits kit to take part. 

Please RSVP so that we stay within the capacity of the room. If it looks like we'll fill up the room, please understand that people who have RSVP'd will be given priority. For full details about location and logistics, and to RSVP, please go to the [event page on Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/226218811/).

The littleBits activity does NOT require a laptop. However, depending on your child, they may want to continue working on their Scratch, Twine, Python or other projects for the latter part of the meeting. We're highly encouraging this, and we still plan to have our regular demo time at the end of the meeting. Please encourage your kids to bring programming projects that they've made so that they can share them with others. We'll certainly have a lot of littleBits demos this meeting, but other projects are definitely welcome. This is one of the favorite parts of CoderDojo meetings, so you won't want to miss out!

This meeting is part of the [Maryland STEM Festival](http://marylandstemfestival.org/), a statewide effort to provide enriching STEM programming and activities for youth throughout Maryland. Visit the STEM Festical website to find more STEM-related activities in your area. The festival runs November 6-15, 2015.

IMPORTANT: Children 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult. And hey, you may even learn how to program too!

ABOUT OUR GROUP: Help kids learn coding skills with a free weekend code club. We're bringing the CoderDojo program of free coding clubs for kids 7-17 to the Washington, DC area. Join up if you're a parent who wants to get their kids involved, a coder who would like to help kids learn, or like a number of our members... you're a parent who codes and wants to do both.
