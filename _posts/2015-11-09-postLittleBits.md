Wow!  Thanks to everyone who came out for the LittleBits Space Kit and Maryland STEM festival meeting on Nov. 8!  There was a great turn out with great energy in the room.  

A special thanks to Ginger Butcher for putting together such a great activity demonstrating how to build a grappler claw using LittleBits, and to all the mentors and parents who got involved in helping the kids through the lesson.

Our next activity is the virtual planning meeting for mentors which will take place this Thursday (11/12) at 9pm via Google Hangout.  Please see [our Meetup site](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/226605330/) for details on how to join the mentor meeting. 

We hope that many of those who came out will not only return for our next regular meeting in two weeks (Nov. 22), but will also check out the [Maryland STEM Festival website](http://marylandstemfestival.org/) to find additional Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math-related activities to try over the coming week.
