Join us on Sunday, July 3, 2016 at the Thingstitute as we learn about programming 
the fastest computers in the world from experts at the Department of Energy! This 
event is appropriate for all ages from elementary to high school. Please 
[RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/231940644/) so that we know 
how many people to expect. 

Supercomputers are used to solve our biggest science and engineering problems. 
[Titan (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, TN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_%28supercomputer%29) 
is America's fastest supercomputer and can solve one-thousand trillion math 
problems in a single second. Tiny Titan is not a supercomputer but a toy 
supercomputer that acts like a real supercomputer. Tiny Titan shows us how 
supercomputers like Titan work. Come play on Tiny Titan and learn how many 
small computers can work together to solve the world's biggest science and 
engineering problems!
