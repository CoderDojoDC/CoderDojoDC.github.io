Join us Sept. 25 from 12-5 pm at Veterans Place in Silver Spring for the 2016 Silver Spring Maker Faire! As we did in 2014, CoderDojoDC will have a booth at this year's faire, where we will talk about our club and teach visitors how to write their name in binary unicode.

To learn more about the faire, see [https://www.makerfairesilverspring.com](https://www.makerfairesilverspring.com). To sign up for a timeslot to staff the booth, please go to: [http://coderdojodc.com/booth](http://coderdojodc.com/booth)
