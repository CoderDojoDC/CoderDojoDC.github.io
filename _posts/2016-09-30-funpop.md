Jonathan Schneider and Rachit Agarwal, local creators of iOS game FunPop, will be visiting to talk about what it's like to be a mobile game developer and will be demoing FunPop! See the [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/234204971/) for more information and to RSVP.

After the presentation, join us for some coding with friends using Scratch, Minecraft, HTML, Arduinos and more. Everyone will have a chance to demo their projects at the end of the meeting time permitting.
