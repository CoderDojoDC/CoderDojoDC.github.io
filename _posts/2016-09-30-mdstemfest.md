To RSVP for this meeting, go to [our Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/events/234064049/).

As part of the [2nd Maryland STEM Festival](http://marylandstemfestival.org/), join CoderDojoDC for a presentation by Rick Kelly, professional game designer and creator of Heroes Guard!

Rick Kelly left a job at ZeniMax working on Elder Scrolls Online to start his own game company, [UnderByte Studios](http://www.underbytestudios.com/heroes-guard/). He will be speaking to the club about his background in computer science, what it's like to start your own game company, and the creation of his game, Heroes Guard. According to [GeekDad](https://geekdad.com/2016/06/independent-game-developer/), the game is "part interactive fiction, part digital card game, you play as a member of the Heroes Guard, a group of mages who use their special skills to protect the land. You fight orcs, play with magical rings, and explore the countryside (before your candle burns down!) as story melds with card game. Itâ€™s available on both [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heroes-guard-the-journal/id968451126) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.underbytestudios.heroesguard.journal&hl=en)."
