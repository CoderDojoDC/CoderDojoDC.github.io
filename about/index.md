### The best way to learn more is to watch a video:

If you know a child who wants to learn how to code or if youâ€™d be interested in
helping out, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coderdojodc")
and follow us at [@CoderDojoDC](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoDC).

We usually meet every other Sunday afternoon. The [CoderDojoDC Meetup
Page](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/) lists our meeting times and locations.
Please RSVP yourself and your children to help us plan and avoid overcrowding
our locations.

## What to bring

Our meetings are free and open to all children. Children 12 and under must
bring a parent, but we strongly encourage all parents to stay and help out. If
you have a laptop, please bring it, but it is not required. We work with
[Codestarter](https://codestarter.org/) to help every child who's
interested in programming to have their own computer. Talk to us at a meeting if
you are interested in applying for a free laptop.

The most important things to bring, though, are your creativity, energy and a
desire to share what you know and learn what you don't. If you're already
working on a programming project, feel free to bring it too and present it at the
end.

## What to expect

Our meetings are 2 hours long, and we follow a similar format for each one. We
start with a full group presentation or activity and then break up into sections
based on programming interests. (Don't know where to go? Don't worry, we'll help
if it's your first time.) If the full group presentation involves an activity
some children will continue working on that activity for the next hour. Other
children will continue work on Scratch, Arduino, HTML or other projects of their
own or by the recommendation of mentors. Children are welcome to look at the
projects being worked on and also encourage to help out others.  At the end, we
come back together and everyone is encouraged to present their work to the
group. This is one of the most fun and rewarding parts of the meeting, so don't
leave early.
