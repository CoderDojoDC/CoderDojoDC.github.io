## About CoderDojo and CoderDojoDC

### The best way to learn more is to watch a video:

If you know a child who wants to learn how to code or if youâ€™d be interested in
helping out, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coderdojodc")
and follow us at [@CoderDojoDC](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoDC).

We meet on Sunday afternoons, usually every two weeks. The [Rockville Science Center 
Makerspace's Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/Rockville-RSC-Makerspace/) 
lists each of our meetings among their events, so that is the best place to find up to date meeting information. 
Please RSVP yourself and your children to help us plan and ensure there is enough space.

### What to bring

Our meetings are free and open to all children. Children 12 and under must
bring a parent, but we strongly encourage all parents to stay and help out. If
you have a laptop, please bring it, but it is not required. We have Raspberry 
Pi workstations for participants who did not bring a laptop.

The most important things to bring, though, are your creativity, energy and a
desire to share what you know and learn what you don't. If you're already
working on a programming project, feel free to bring it too and present it at the
end.

### Software to install (optional)

Most of our participants work on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), [Twine](twinery.org), or [Python](python.org). If you are able to bring a laptop for your child to use during the meetings, it is helpful if you can install some of the free software we use for our activities in advance of the meeting.  Brief descriptions of our core technologies and links to installation pages are available on our [installation guide page](http://coderdojodc.com/installation.html).

### What to expect

Our meetings are 2 hours long, and we follow a similar format for each one. We
start with a full group presentation or activity and then break up into sections
based on programming interests. (Don't know where to go? Don't worry, we'll help
if it's your first time.) If the full group presentation involves an activity
some children will continue working on that activity for the next hour. Other
children will continue work on Scratch, Arduino, HTML or other projects of their
own or by the recommendation of mentors. Children are welcome to look at the
projects being worked on and also encourage to help out others.  At the end, we
come back together and everyone is encouraged to present their work to the
group. This is one of the most fun and rewarding parts of the meeting, so don't
leave early.
