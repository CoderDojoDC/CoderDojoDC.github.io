### The best way to learn more is to watch a video:

If you know a child who wants to learn how to code or if youâ€™d be interested in
helping out, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coderdojodc")
and follow us at [@CoderDojoDC](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoDC).

We usually meet every other Sunday afternoon. The [CoderDojoDC Meetup
Page](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/) lists our meeting times and locations.
Please RSVP yourself and your children to help us plan and avoid overcrowding
our locations.

## What to bring

Our meetings are free and open to all children. Children 12 and under must
bring a parent, but we strongly encourage all parents to stay and help out. If
you have a laptop, please bring it, but this is not required. We work with
[Codestarter](https://codestarter.org/) to help every child who's
interested in programming to have their own computer. Talk to us at a meeting if
you are interested in this.

The most important things to bring, though, are your creativity, energy and a
desire to share what you known and learn what you don't. If you're already
working on a programming project, feel free to bring it and present it at the
end.

## What to expect

Our meetings are 2 hours long, and we follow a similar format for each one.
After a brief intro to the group, children and mentors break up into sections
based on programming interests. (Don't know where to go? Don't worry, we'll help
if it's your first time.) Depending on the meeting, we may have a mentor or
student present to their section or to the whole group. From then on, everyone
works on their projects. We have many people who choose to work together on
projects, and some who switch from group to group to try out new programming
lanugages. At the end, we come back together and everyone is encouraged to
present their work to the group.
