## Badge System for CoderdojoDC

Welcome to the Coderdojo badge system.  This overview should help you get started earning badge stickers that will go on your permanent nametag.  Please put your nametag in your computer bag and bring it with you to each meeting so people can see which badges you’ve earned.

We’ve created this badge system to fulfill three goals: to **encourage** ninjas to try new projects, to **award** ninjas for taking those projects to completion, and to **build** community as ninjas reach out to one another to learn and teach.

The base badges currently come in **four different categories**, though there may be special badges in the future assigned to certain projects and challenges.  The categories are

* Yellow (Frank): **Scratch**
* Blue (Melissa): **Twine**
* Red (Josh): **Programming** Language (such as Python or Javascript)
* Green (Gwen): **Ninja’s Choice** (such as Blockly, Arduino, App Inventor, or a project introduced by a presenter, such as the 8-bit music).

Each category contains three levels:

* **Learn**: dedicate at least three sessions learning about the topic.  Please let the mentor in charge of the badge know that you are trying for the badge so they can track your three lessons.
* **Do**: work on a project that utilizes your new skills, complete it, and show it to the group and/or upload it to the Coderdojo site.
* **Teach**: lead a short presentation (10 minutes) at the beginning of a meeting about your topic, or teach another ninja for three meetings so they can earn their "learn" badge.

Each level earns one badge, therefore, mastery will be three badges in Scratch (or choose a category) corresponding to the three levels.

So how does this look in practice?  Here’s an example for someone going after the Twine badges:

* **Learn**: the ninja will sit at the Twine table and let the mentor know that he or she wants to learn Twine and is going after their first badge.  The mentor or another ninja can help the ninja learn basic skills in Twine.
* **Do**: the ninja works on a project during Coderdojo or at home (or both!), incorporating what they learned during those three lessons.  They finish the project, present it at the end of a meeting, and send it to one of the mentors so it can be uploaded onto the Coderdojo site so others can play it.
* **Teach**: the ninja shows the group how he or she created the variables they included in their game in a brief presentation at the beginning of a Coderdojo meeting.

After each step (learn, do, teach), the ninja will earn the appropriate sticker.  At the end of all three steps, the ninja will have three stickers.

While we’d love for ninjas to try all four categories, we’re also okay with a ninja earning category badges a second, third, or fourth time.  

Should you always be working on badges?  Of course not!  Sometimes you want to play around with something new.  We want to still encourage that with Coderdojo, but we also want to create a system for ninjas that want to take their experience to the next level.

The badge system will also be helpful in identifying other knowledgeable ninjas.  Have a question about Scratch?  Look for someone with a lot of yellow stickers on their nametag.  Have a question about Twine?  Look for ones that have a lot of blue.

Have fun diving into the Coderdojo badge system.  We can’t wait to see what you create.
