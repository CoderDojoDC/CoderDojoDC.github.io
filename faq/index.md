# Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does CoderDojoDC cost?

Nothing! One of the core rules of the CoderDojo format is to keep everything
low-stress, by avoiding introducing any costs for anyone, for anything.  We
are completely dependent on volunteers and donated equipment and space to meet.

### My child is not yet 7 years old, can s/he still attend?

We do not turn away younger children, but content, activities and resources are
specifically geared towards 7-17 year-olds.

### I am over 17 - may I register to attend?

CoderDojo is geared only towards 7 to 17 year-olds.  If you’d like to attend to
teach, volunteer or just observe, please drop us a line to discuss:
DC@CoderDojo.com

### May I leave my child?

A parent or guardian must stay with children 12 and under, but all parents
are strongly encouraged to stay and participate.  CoderDojoDC is a free,
public club and assumes no responsibility for the welfare of older attendees.
If an older child leaves or must be asked to leave for whatever reason, or
his or her parent fails to pick the child up before the end of the meeting,
CoderDojoDC’s volunteers cannot be held responsible for that child’s welfare.

### Do you have a mailing list?

[CoderDojoDC@GoogleGroups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coderdojodc)
is where we all share work between meetings, plan, ask questions, and provide
each other technical support and encouragement. Please consider signing up for
the email list.

### When is your next meeting?

We usually meet every other weekend. See [our meetup.com
site](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/) for time, location, and RSVP.

### Why do I have to register for each meeting?

Most CoderDojo’s find there’s just to much turn-around from one meeting to the
next and, maybe because it’s a free event, it’s hard to find enough people to
commit to more than one meeting at a time.  By opening registration for each
meeting, we’re able to accommodate new faces, while avoiding exceeding the
capacity of the room.

### You're called CoderDojoDC, but you meet in Maryland. Why?

First, if your drive takes a while to get to CoderDojoDC, thanks for making the
trip. Given that we never want to charge anyone for coming to our meetings, we
can only meet in low cost or sponsored locations. We initially found these in
Maryland. If you're coming from Virgina,
take a look at our partner Dojo, [CoderDojoNova](http://www.coderdojonova.co/).

### How does my child earn badges?

We haven’t worked this out yet - would anyone like to take the lead on this?

### How can I help?

By far our most urgent need is just for people to help mentor, everything from
HTML to Rasberry Pi’s. We need not-terribly-old laptops to revive with Ubuntu,
to be available to kids unable to bring their own.  And we can always use extra
mice, power strips, extension cords, thumbdrives, swag, popcorn, maybe a gong?

### Other questions?
