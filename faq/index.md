# Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does CoderDojoDC cost?

Nothing!  One of the core rules of the CoderDojo format is to keep everything low-stress, by avoiding introducing any costs for anyone, for anything.  We are completely dependent on volunteers and donated equipment and space to meet.

### My child is not yet 9 years old, can s/he still attend?

Children as young as 7 are welcome with an accompanying parent, but content, activities and resources are specifically geared towards 9-17 year-olds.

### I am over 17 - may I register to attend?

CoderDojo is geared only towards 9 to 17 year-olds.  If you’d like to attend to teach, volunteer or just observe, please drop us a line to discuss: DC@CoderDojo.com

### May I leave my child?

A parent or guardian must stay with children 12 and under, but all parents are strongly encouraged to stay and participate.  CoderDojoDC is a free, public club, held in a public building and assumes no responsibility for the welfare of older attendees.  If an older child leaves or must be asked to leave for whatever reason, or his or her parent fails to pick the child up before the end of the meeting, CoderDojoDC’s volunteers cannot be held responsible for that child’s welfare.

### What should I bring, how should I prepare?

We have only a very limited number of laptops available to attendees unable to bring their own, so if you can bring your own, please do so.  We can also advise you on finding a cheap >$100 used laptop to revive with Ubuntu and which will be fine for most everything we work on.  You might also want to bring a mouse, pad, snack.  Most important things to bring are your creativity, energy and a desire to share what you know and learn what you don’t.

### Do you have a mailing list?

[CoderDojoDC@GoogleGroups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coderdojodc) is where we all share work between meetings, plan, ask questions, and provide each other technical support and encouragement. Please consider signing up for the email list.

### When is your next meeting?

We usually meet every other weekend. See [our meetup.com site](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/) for time, location,
and RSVP.

### Why do I have to register for each meeting?

Most CoderDojo’s find there’s just to much turn-around from one meeting to the next and, maybe because it’s a free event, it’s hard to find enough people to commit to more than one meeting at a time.  By opening registration for each meeting, we’re able to accommodate new faces, while avoiding exceeding the capacity of the room.

### How does my child earn badges?

We haven’t worked this out yet - would anyone like to take the lead on this?

### How can I help?

By far our most urgent need is just for people to help mentor, everything from HTML to Rasberry Pi’s. We need not-terribly-old laptops to revive with Ubuntu, to be available to kids unable to bring their own.  And we can always use extra mice, power strips, extension cords, thumbdrives, swag, popcorn, maybe a gong?
