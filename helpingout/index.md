# Helping out

For more than four years now, our Coderdojo has been meeting regularly, helping kids learn and teach each other new skills in computer programming. In that time we have accomplished so much, and seen the kids who come to our bi-monthly meetups express their creativity and ingenuity in countless show-and-tell demonstrations of Scratch projects, Twine games, Raspberry Pi programs and so much more. Our doors are open to any child who wants to enter and we’ve helped provide laptops, Raspberry Pi’s and other technology to kids who otherwise wouldn’t have had access to them.

We do this as volunteers and charge nothing for participation.

## Donations

Like any organization we have expenses like insurance, maintaining our Meetup website and technology that ages or breaks and needs replacing. If you're in a position to help, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to our 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor, Make a Difference Engine (EIN: 47-2723442). You can donate via PayPal below or contact us at dc@coderdojo.com if you'd prefer to send a check.

We also can use hardware donations. If you have HDMI/DVI monitors, Raspberry Pi 3 hardware (and peripherals), and kid-appropriate programming books, we may be able to make use of them. Please email us at dc@coderdojo.com or talk to us at one of our meetings about this.

## Mentoring and Presenting

We're always looking for enthusiastic mentors and speakers for our meetings. If you or someone you know uses computer programming in their jobs or hobbies and would like to share their work or experiences with the group, please let us know. We've had presentations ranging from creating writing and music generation to robotics and quantum computing. You never know what topic will resonate with a student and pique their interest in computer programming.
