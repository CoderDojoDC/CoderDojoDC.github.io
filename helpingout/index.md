## Helping out

CoderDojoDC was founded in December 2012. We run sessions that meet every
other week thanks to the generosity of our volunteers and sponsors. This has
allowed us to keep our Dojo free and open to all Washington, DC area youth.

## Mentoring

We are always looking for enthusiastic mentors to help out at our meetings. The
children have worked on everything from Scratch, HTML, Minecraft
modding, interactive fiction, to building hardware projects with Arduinos and
Raspberry Pis and computer animation with Blender. We also encourage discovery
of new topics in short presentations at the beginning of each meeting. As you
might expect, mentoring this group is anything but dull. Please contact us at
dc@coderdojo.com before you show up so that we can talk about how best you can help out.

## Donations

CoderDojoDC will always be free and open to all youth. We do incur costs to keep the group
active and fund activities requiring hardware or software purchases. If you are
in a position to help, please consider making a donation through our fiscal
sponsor, Make a Difference Engine, Inc. You may donate via PayPal below.

Please contact us at dc@coderdojo.com if you have any questions or would prefer
to mail a check.

We are also in need of hardware donations of Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, Makey
Makeys and the various parts needed to use them. If you have an Arduino
or other hardware sitting in your basement collecting dust, please consider
donating it. As a free computer club, we will never require children to purchase
anything to come to our meetings, and we currently do not have nearly enough
hardware to properly teach the whole group about all of the awesome things that can be
done with these devices. Your hardware donation will get used. Email us if
dropping off a hardware donation at one of our meetings is inconvenient.
