# About
Our meetings are free and open to all children. Children 12 and under must
bring a parent/grown-up, but we strongly encourage all parents to stay and help out.

The best way to learn more is to watch a video:

If you know a child who wants to learn how to code or if youâ€™d be interested in
helping out, join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/coderdojodc")
and follow us at [@CoderDojoDC](https://twitter.com/CoderDojoDC).

We usually meet every other Sunday afternoon. The [CoderDojoDC Meetup
Page](http://www.meetup.com/CoderDojoDC/) lists our meeting times and locations.
Please RSVP yourself and your children to help us plan and avoid overcrowding
our locations.

## What to bring

If you have a laptop, please bring it, but it is not required. In the past we have worked with [Codestarter](https://codestarter.org/) to help every child who's interested in programming to have their own computer, but unfortunately the Codestarter program has ended. We are currently investigating some options to create a similar program that would allow us to facilitate getting good starter laptops for programming into the hands of kids who need them.  If you are able to help us in this effort (for example, by helping us to spec a good, inexpensive laptop, or to develop an installation image including Linux and some free software useful for programming -- along the lines of [Codestarter's Chromebook installer](https://github.com/codestarterorg/ubuntu-chromebook-installer)), please get in touch!

The most important things to bring, though, are your creativity, energy and a
desire to share what you know and learn what you don't. If you're already
working on a programming project, feel free to bring it too and present it at the
end.

## Software to install (optional)

If you are able to bring a laptop for your child to use during the meetings, it is helpful if you can install some of the free software we use for our activities in advance of the meeting.  Brief descriptions of our core technologies and links to installation pages are available on our [installation guide page](http://coderdojodc.com/installation.html).

## What to expect

Our 2 hour meetings typically start with a full group presentation or activity and then break up into sections
based on programming interests. Volunteer mentors are available to provide help, but often the kids will help and inspire each other.  (Don't know where to go? Don't worry, we'll help
if it's your first time.) If the full group presentation involves a guided activity,
some children will continue working on that activity for the next hour. Other
children will continue work on Scratch, Arduino, HTML or other projects of their
own or by the recommendation of mentors. We set aside the last half hour for the kids to share a project - this is one of the most fun and rewarding parts of the meeting, so don't
leave early! Find examples of our members' projects on our [showcase page](http://coderdojodc.com/showcase/).
