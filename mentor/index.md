# Mentor

We're always looking for enthusiastic mentors and speakers for our meetings. If
you or someone you know uses computer programming in their jobs or hobbies and
would like to share their work or experiences with the group, please let us
know. We've had presentations ranging from creating writing and music
generation to robotics and quantum computing. You never know what topic will
resonate with a student and pique their interest in computer programming.

We have regular mentor meeting conference calls every other Thursday. If you're
interested, go to our meetup.com/coderdojodc site for details. Feel free to
join us at one of our Sunday meetings if you'd like to observe. Depending on
how busy we are, we may not have time to talk to you, but we'll certainly try
to touch base afterwards.
